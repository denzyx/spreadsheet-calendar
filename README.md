# sheetcal
An ugly script to create events with reminders in Google Calendar for upcoming public mocks (for https://t.me/FaangInterview).

What you need to make it work:
* Python3
* Install necessary modules:

```pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib```

Run it with the schedule spreadsheet id as follows:

 ```SHEETS_ID=... python3 sheetcal.py```
